    &lt;p&gt;Dear beloved,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we started going out i kept a note of each and every thoughts uttered in my mind that would otherwise be fantasy, had we never get this close. You've seen it once so i don't know if you remember or not. Even if you don't, you'd probably be able to tell some of the things i am thinking since you've come to be able to tell of how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this comes out as unstructured jumbled strings of words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are times when you find the words i couldn't muster for myself. When you'd ask of my opinion, you'd know whenever i am still holding some stuff in. When you'd find worry for my shortcomings when none of them even crossed my mind. You become the center of the universe and the farther i am from you the longer time passes, and the more I feel something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never find any bore of holding your hands. Of rummaging your finger, of tangling my hands with yours, of entrusting you with my restless arms, of feeling the warmth of your hands or of sharing mine whenever they leave for your cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think i can answer &quot;what is love?&quot;, i am not able to anyway since i can't put into words how i feel accurately. With you, i want to share my lung, my heart and my body. So you might know how my lungs feel like it's emptied of air, how my heart skips every or so beat catching up with how i feel and how my body longs to be near you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aku ingin  bersamamu. Sampai semua kata di keyboardku sepanjang kata pagiku untukmu. Sampai semua suara pikiranku bernada suaramu. Sampai semua bagian-bagianku menjadi bagianmu, serta kebalikannya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&quot;color: #2596be;&quot;&gt;I've thought of many inappropriate things. I've said many inappropriate things, these are the same.  I want to be with you. I want to embrace you, untill our warmths are the same. I want to kiss you, until you are the only sensation i feel. I want to feel your warm breath, hitting the side of my neck. I want to leave an impression on you, as big as you have to me. I want you, come over and love me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I've said. I always reserve a corner of my mind and a big part of my heart for you. Ever bright, ever endearing, ever lovable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear beloved,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
